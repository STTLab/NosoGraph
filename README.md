# BactGraph
NosoGraph is a graph database which is a structured representation of information where entities (e.g., objects and concepts) are nodes, and their relationships are edges, forming a graph of interconnected data. NosoGraph plays a crucial role in building knowledge graphs by efficiently storing and querying these complex, interconnected datasets, allowing for the retrieval of information based on relationships rather than just discrete data points. NosoGraph can be used to map the relationships between microorganisms, their genetic information, metabolic pathways, interactions with environments or hosts, and related epidemiological data of the microorganisms of interest.
